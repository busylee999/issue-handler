The challenge of using this library it is simplify to store bug issues of your developing Android projects \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n1. Handling uncaugth exceptions and posting it to preinstalled IssueBot Android Application on phone your app running for posting it to bug-tracker system IssueBot supports.\r\n2. Installing IssueBot if it is not on the phone.\r\n3. Automatic attaching addition files you need to store for issue in bug tracker.\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\n1. Add dependency for you project.\r\n2. Add init code in Application.\r\n3. Specify server url and file path\r\n\r\nYou can look for sample project.\r\n\r\n### Adding dependency for project:\r\n\r\nUsing gradle:\r\n\r\nAdd external repository in build.gragle file in your gradle module folder uses this lib or edit build.gradle file for all project:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    apply plugin: 'com.android.application'\r\n    \r\n    repositories {\r\n            mavenCentral()\r\n            maven {\r\n              url 'http://tryremember.ru:8383/archiva/repository/mvn'\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    android {\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n\r\nAnd add dependency:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    dependency {\r\n    ...\r\n    compile 'com.busylee.issuehandler:issuehandler:2.0.1'\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nThis is preffered approach. But it is suitable only if you have internet connection.\r\n\r\nUsing arr file:\r\n\r\nSimple download latest version of aar file from aar-files directory of this repository and add it as dependency for your project.\r\n\r\n### Using in project:\r\nIn your custom application class add IssueHandler init in on create method. Issue handler lib now uses Application context for create intents for aware user about Exception.\r\n\r\n    public void onCreate() {\r\n        IssueHandler.init(this)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nAnd add annotation for your Application class. This annotation defines library setting.\r\n\r\n    @IssueHandlerSetup(\r\n            serverUrl = \"your/redmine/server/path\"\r\n            filePath = \"/path/to/file/from/application/private/directory\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\nIf file path is specified in @IssueHandlerSetup annotation, assumed that file located in application private directory. This file must be marked as readable for another application.\r\nFile location is not a required parameter. If your file location is constant specify it in annotation, otherwise you can ommit filePath definition in annotation and specify it in init method\r\n\r\n    IssueHandler.init(this, \"path/to/file/be/attached\");\r\n\r\nNote: If you want to attach file for issue you need to specify file permissions as readable for everybody especially if you created it in application own directory.\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\nLatest version in mvn repo is 2.0.1.\r\n\r\nNew in 2.0.1:\r\n- Removed dependency from activity. It is no matter now where Exception was occured.\r\n- Added IssueHandlerSetup annotation for simplifying setup of library.\r\n- Auto detection absolute path of file for attach, if it is specified in annotation.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2013 Square, Inc.\r\n    \r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n    \r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n    \r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"UA-59517129-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
